Snakemake-cnvseq-qdnaseq
========================

|Snakemake| |Wercker|

Snakemake-cnvseq-qdnaseq is a snakemake workflow that generates copy number
profiles/calls from CNV-seq (shallow whole genome sequencing) data. The
workflow is designed to handle single-end and (optionally) multi-lane sequencing
data. The actual copy number profiles and calls are generated using the
QDNAseq R package.

If you use this workflow in a paper, don't forget to give credits
to the authors by citing the URL of this repository and, if available, its
DOI (see above).
